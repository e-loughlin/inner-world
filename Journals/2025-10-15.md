I'm feeling extraordinarily overwhelmed right now. 

I'm 36, newly single again.

I have good prospects, in that I'm relatively successful and capable. I think there are still many women that would like me. 

I've been talking with Kristin a lot, but I'm concerned, to be honest. She's really awesome in every way and we have a ton in common. But she's 35 and I really want to have kids. It would be a huge risk.
