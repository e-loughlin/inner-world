I'm feeling extraordinarily overwhelmed right now. 

I'm 36, newly single again.

I have good prospects, in that I'm relatively successful and capable. I think there are still many women that would like me. 

I've been talking with Kristin a lot, but I'm concerned, to be honest. She's really awesome in every way and we have a ton in common. But she's 35 and I really want to have kids. It would be a huge risk that I'm not sure I'm ready for. Plus, she seems like she has an anxious attachment style, like me. 

But down to my local problems...

I have notified Neara that I might not be long with the company. I have another interview lined up for this
