I'm feeling extraordinarily overwhelmed right now. 

I'm 36, newly single again.
- So what might life look like me?
- Find a partner who's ~30 who wants to settle down and have kids?
- 

I have good prospects, in that I'm relatively successful and capable. I think there are still many women that would like me. 

I've been talking with Kristin a lot, but I'm concerned, to be honest. She's really awesome in every way and we have a ton in common. But she's 35 and I really want to have kids. It would be a huge risk that I'm not sure I'm ready for. Plus, she seems like she has an anxious attachment style, like me. There's also the whole "too close to family" thing, given that she's Stu's sister-in-law.

But down to my local problems...

I have notified Neara that I might not be long with the company. I have another interview lined up for this Friday. I should probably get some practice in before that happens. 

I need to sell this van. Maybe I can make some progress there. 

I'm deeply depressed thinking that I might never have a family and kids, or a wife that loves me. I'm feeling like a complete failure. It's horrible. I also feel like I still have so many personality defects and issues that it's so incredibly hard to get through it all. I almost feel like my brain is hard-wired to constantly make bad decisions, to push away good people, to prevent me from experiencing joy, to prevent me from having confidence and having deep love. 

What is going on?
