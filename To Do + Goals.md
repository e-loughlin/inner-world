Reminders:
- You are loveable. This is an extraordinary effort you're doing because you're trying to heal. This work is an act of love to yourself and to the people in your life who love you. It's an act of kindness, love, and gratitude for life itself. It can be extremely hard to face hard truths about yourself, and your past. Doing so with love, not shame, is the answer. 
- Everything that has happened, everything that you've ever done, has come from a part that was trying to help, heal, or protect you, even if it was obvious that the actions had severely negative affects. The more you find love and kindness and forgiveness of your own parts, the more you'll enable them to help you heal and become whole again.
- The trauma that led you to this point was not your fault. Healing it will help you have more compassion for others.
- It's this work, this hard introspection, that will help you achieve what it is that you truly wish in life. Inner peace. Calmness. Love. Kindness. Care. Self actualization. Success. Creativity. Music,
